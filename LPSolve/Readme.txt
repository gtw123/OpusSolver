Some of the code in this project is based on the C# example code from lp_solve. Since lp_solve is licensed under LGPL,
this modified code and in fact this entire C# project must be licensed under LGPL as well. However, since this project
builds to a shared library, using it within OpusSolver does not mean the rest of OpusSolver needs to also be licensed
under LGPL.
